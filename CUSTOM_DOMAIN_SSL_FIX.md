# Fix SSL Certificate for Custom Domain (gigfloww.com)

## The Issue
You're getting "Your connection is not private" error because the SSL certificate doesn't match your custom domain.

## Solution

### 1. Configure Custom Domain in Replit
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click on the "Webview" pane (where your app preview shows)
3. Click on the pencil icon next to the URL
4. Add your custom domain: `gigfloww.com`
5. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

### 2. DNS Configuration
You need to add these DNS records at your domain registrar:

**For root domain (gigfloww.com):**
- Type: A
- Name: @ (or leave blank)
- Value: 35.190.25.139

**For www subdomain (www.gigfloww.com):**
- Type: CNAME
- Name: www
- Value: service-genie-ashutoshlathrep.replit.app

### 3. Wait for SSL Certificate
- After DNS propagation (5-30 minutes), Replit will automatically provision an SSL certificate
- The certificate is issued by Let's Encrypt
- This process can take up to 24 hours

### 4. Temporary Workaround
While waiting for SSL:
1. Click "Advanced" on the warning page
2. Click "Proceed to gigfloww.com (unsafe)"
3. This is safe since it's your own site

### 5. Alternative Access
You can always access your app at:
- https://service-genie-ashutoshlathrep.replit.app (this has valid SSL)

## Checking SSL Status
Once configured, you can verify SSL at:
