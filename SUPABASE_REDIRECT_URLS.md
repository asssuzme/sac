# Supabase Redirect URLs Configuration

You need to add these URLs in the **Redirect URLs** section (not the Site URL field):

1. Click the "Add URL" button in the Redirect URLs section
2. Add each of these URLs one by one:

```
https://gigfloww.com/auth/callback
https://www.gigfloww.com/auth/callback
https://service-genie-ashutoshlathrep.replit.app/auth/callback
http://localhost:5000/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

## Important Notes:

- **Site URL**: Keep this as `https://gigfloww.com` (only one URL allowed here)
- **Redirect URLs**: Add ALL the URLs listed above (you can add multiple URLs here)

The Redirect URLs section allows multiple entries - just click "Add URL" for each one.

After adding all the URLs, click "Save changes" at the bottom of the page.
