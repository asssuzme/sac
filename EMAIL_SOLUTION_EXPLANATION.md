# Email Sending Solution Explanation

## The Challenge
You need to send emails FROM users' personal email addresses (like john@gmail.com), not from a generic address.

## Why Supabase SMTP Won't Work
- Supabase SMTP configuration only allows sending from ONE fixed email address
- It cannot send emails from different user email addresses
- Each user would need to provide their email password (security risk!)

## Our Solution: Email Client Integration
Instead of sending emails directly, we:

1. **Generate the email content** using AI
2. **Save it to the database** for tracking
3. **Open it in the user's email client** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. **User sends it themselves** from their own email account

## How It Works
When user clicks "Send Email":
- If they're using Gmail → Opens Gmail compose window with email pre-filled
- If using other email → Opens their default email app with email pre-filled
- User just needs to click "Send" in their email client

## Benefits
✓ Emails come from user's actual email address
✓ No need for user passwords or OAuth permissions
✓ Works with any email provider
✓ User maintains full control
✓ Still tracks all applications in the database

## User Experience
1. User generates personalized email in the app
2. Clicks "Send Email" 
3. Their email client opens with everything filled in
4. They review and click send
5. Email is sent from their personal account

This is the most secure and user-friendly approach when you can't use OAuth with proper permissions!
