Major Bug Fixes for AI JobHunter Application

Fixed Critical Issues:
1. PDF Parsing - Fixed incorrect import causing all PDF uploads to fail
2. Resume Upload Redundancy - Users no longer asked to upload multiple times
3. Email Generation - Fixed success detection (was checking wrong field)
4. Frontend Timeout - Extended to 35s for AI email generation (takes 20-30s)
5. Resume Caching - Fixed stale data issues with proper cache invalidation
6. Email Context - Now includes full job description for personalized emails
7. Email Sending - Fixed undefined recipient/job info not being passed

Technical Changes:
- Fixed pdf-parse import in server/simple-routes.ts
- Updated success check from data.success to data.email in filtered-job-card.tsx
- Added proper cache invalidation in settings.tsx and results.tsx
- Extended apiRequest timeout to 35s for email generation
