# Google OAuth Verification Fix Guide

## Current Issues

Based on the Google OAuth verification screenshot, there are two issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Homepage requirements** - "Your home page does not include a link to your privacy policy"
2. **Privacy policy requirements** - "Your privacy policy URL is the same as your home page URL"

## What We've Fixed on Your Website

I've made the following changes to ensure Google can find your privacy policy:

1. ✅ **Added prominent Privacy Policy link in the hero section** - Immediately visible without scrolling
2. ✅ **Added Privacy Policy link in the navigation header** - Visible at the top of the page
3. ✅ **Privacy Policy link already exists in the footer** - Additional visibility
4. ✅ **Created dedicated pages**:
   - Privacy Policy: `https://gigfloww.com/privacy-policy`
   - Terms of Service: `https://gigfloww.com/terms-of-service`

## What You Need to Do in Google Cloud Console

### Step 1: Update OAuth 2.0 Consent Screen Configuration

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
3. Click **Edit App**

### Step 2: Update the URLs

In the **App information** section, make sure these URLs are set correctly:

- **Application home page**: `https://gigfloww.com`
- **Privacy policy link**: `https://gigfloww.com/privacy-policy`
- **Terms of service link**: `https://gigfloww.com/terms-of-service`

**IMPORTANT**: The privacy policy URL must be different from the homepage URL!

### Step 3: Gmail OAuth Issue - FIXED

~~You're getting "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch" because the Gmail OAuth redirect URI is not authorized.~~

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: I've fixed the Gmail OAuth problem by updating the code to use the existing Google OAuth tokens (which already include Gmail permissions) instead of requiring a separate Gmail authorization flow. Users no longer need to authorize Gmail separately since they already granted those permissions during the main Google sign-in.

The "redirect_uri_mismatch" error should no longer occur when users try to send emails via Gmail.

### Step 4: Save and Submit

1. Click **Save and Continue**
2. Review all sections
3. Submit for verification

## Why This Should Now Pass Verification

1. **Privacy Policy is now prominently visible** on the homepage in 3 locations:
   - Hero section (immediately visible without scrolling)
   - Navigation header
   - Footer

2. **URLs are different**:
   - Homepage: `https://gigfloww.com`
   - Privacy Policy: `https://gigfloww.com/privacy-policy`

3. **All pages are publicly accessible** without authentication

## Troubleshooting

If verification still fails:

1. **Wait 24-48 hours** - Google needs time to re-crawl your site
2. **Test in incognito mode** - Ensure privacy policy link is visible without login
3. **Check Google's crawler** - Visit https://gigfloww.com and verify the privacy policy link is visible
4. **Clear browser cache** - Ensure you're seeing the latest version

## Additional Notes

- Google's verification system checks that your homepage has a visible link to your privacy policy
- The privacy policy must be on the same domain as your homepage
- Both pages must be accessible without authentication
- The verification process typically takes 24-72 hours after submission
