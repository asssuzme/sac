# Setting Up Custom Domain on Replit (Complete Guide)

## The Problem
You're accessing gigfloww.com directly, but it hasn't been properly configured through Replit's deployment system, which is why SSL isn't working.

## Solution - Deploy Your App First

### Step 1: Deploy Your Application
1. In your Replit workspace, click the **"Deploy"** button (rocket icon) in the header
2. Choose deployment type:
   - **Static** (for frontend only)
   - **Autoscale** (recommended for full-stack apps)
   - **Reserved VM** (for consistent performance)

### Step 2: Link Your Custom Domain
1. After deployment, go to the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click on your deployment
3. Go to **"Settings"** tab
4. Click **"Link a domain"** or **"Manually connect from another registrar"**
5. Enter: `gigfloww.com`

### Step 3: Configure DNS Records
Replit will show you DNS records to add at your domain registrar:

**A Record:**
- Type: A
- Name: @ (or gigfloww.com)
- Value: [IP address provided by Replit]

**TXT Record:**
- Type: TXT
- Name: @ (or gigfloww.com)
- Value: [Verification string provided by Replit]

### Step 4: Add Records at Your Domain Registrar
1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Go to DNS Management
3. Add the A and TXT records exactly as shown by Replit
4. Save changes

### Step 5: Wait for Verification
- DNS propagation: 5 minutes to 48 hours
- Once verified, status will show "Verified"
- SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned

## Temporary Solution (Use Replit URL)
While waiting for deployment, use:
**https://service-genie-ashutoshlathrep.replit.app**

This URL has valid SSL and works immediately.

## Important Notes
- You must deploy through Replit's deployment system
- Don't use Cloudflare proxy (turn off orange cloud)
- Remove any existing A records pointing elsewhere
- Custom domains require a paid Replit plan
